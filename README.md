heart disease prediction using machine learning (SVM model with highest accuracy kernel)
For this project, several Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels were tested, such as Linear, Polynomial, Sigmoid, and RBF. The model was trained on a cardiovascular disease dataset following appropriate preprocessing steps like feature scaling.

Out of all kernels, the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel gave the best performance with:
-Accuracy: 97.5%
-Precision (No Disease): 0.96
-Precision (Disease): 0.98
-Recall: 0.97–0.98 for both classes
-F1-score: 0.97–0.98
The RBF model correctly classified 81 true negatives and 114 true positives, and misclassified only 5 out of 200 test samples.
